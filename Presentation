INSPIRATION:

OPENING:
  (IF We GET SELECTED)How many of you have ever received a ticket for speeding or red light offence?
                      How many of you DON'T WANT to receive one?
                      Then our app is the solution for you!
    
## PITCH:
  * Between 2016 and 2018 alone, there have been approx 650k cases of speeding and red light offences in NSW which amounted to approx 200m
  in fines.
  * Processing these fees also takes up valuable resources such as time and money for the government and the citizens
  * Currently there's no framework in place that forewarns the drivers about these offences in crime-prone areas such as the
  Pacific Highway for example. 

## USEFULNESS AND ORIGINILAITY
  * Currently, the government just dumps a bunch of data and says, "Here you go!"... 
  * There is no feasible way for the general people to make use of that data.
  * Using the data we have, we created an API endpoint for applications across all platforms to consume. 
  * It is not only scalable, but we can create more API endpoints and potentially create a service
