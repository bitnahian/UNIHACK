## Problem
In 2017-2018 alone, there were approximately 650k cases of speeding and red light offence in NSW. Our application aims to reduce the traffic crimes committed by citizens, in NSW and potentially the whole world. This also has stops the  government from having to spend resources managing all the offences.

## Solution
We are first building an API which keeps track of all the speeding and red light tickets. Using this API, we plan to make an app that notifies people (using voice) when they enter an area with a lot of accidents. The app can also visualize the data so that the user can see which areas have a lot of accidents. Finally, the app can be used to add an accident to the API.
